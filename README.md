## About
This is just a fun project that I made (took about five minutes to make). I realized that it's quite annoying (and impossible) for some people to try and convert binary numbers to text, and while there are applications and websites that can do this, I wanted to do it too, for fun.

## How to use
It's pretty self explanatory. First visit the [website](https://binarytotext.fryingpan.codes) (obviously). Then put the binary numbers in the text box, click "Convert" and it'll convert your binary numbers to text! You can also upload a TXT file full of binary numbers to convert them. If the file does not have binary numbers in them, it will automatically convert that text to binary for you! Once the conversion is complete, you can save the text as a file by clicking the "Save File" button. You can also copy the text.
